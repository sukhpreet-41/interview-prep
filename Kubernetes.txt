Certainly! Here are Kubernetes-related interview questions organized by topic:

**Kubernetes Basics:**

1. What is Kubernetes and why is it important in the context of containerization?
2. Explain the main components of the Kubernetes architecture.
3. What is the difference between a pod and a container in Kubernetes?
4. Describe the role of the Kubernetes control plane.
5. How does Kubernetes handle container orchestration and scheduling?
6. What is the purpose of kubelet in the Kubernetes cluster?

**Deployments and Pods:**

1. How do you define a deployment in Kubernetes? What are its key components?
2. Explain the difference between a replica set and a deployment.
3. How do you scale a deployment in Kubernetes? Can you perform rolling updates during scaling?
4. What is a pod in Kubernetes? How is it different from a deployment?
5. How are environment variables and secrets passed to containers within a pod?
6. What is a readiness probe and why is it useful in a pod configuration?

**Services and Networking:**

1. How do you expose a Kubernetes service internally and externally?
2. What are the different types of service in Kubernetes? Explain their use cases.
3. How does Kubernetes handle service discovery within the cluster?
4. Describe the purpose and functionality of an Ingress resource in Kubernetes.
5. How can you restrict network traffic to pods using network policies?

**Storage and Volumes:**

1. How do you handle persistent storage in Kubernetes?
2. Explain the difference between a persistent volume (PV) and a persistent volume claim (PVC).
3. What is a storage class in Kubernetes? How is it used to provision persistent volumes dynamically?
4. How do you mount a volume to a pod in Kubernetes?
5. What are emptyDir and hostPath volumes? When and how would you use them?

**Scalability and High Availability:**

1. How does Kubernetes handle scaling applications horizontally?
2. Explain the concept of a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes.
3. How can you achieve high availability for applications in a Kubernetes cluster?
4. Describe the rolling update strategy in Kubernetes. How does it ensure zero downtime?
5. What are readiness and liveness probes? How are they used to ensure application availability?

**Advanced Kubernetes Topics:**

1. What is a StatefulSet in Kubernetes? How is it different from a deployment?
2. Explain the concept of a DaemonSet in Kubernetes. Provide a use case.
3. What is a custom resource definition (CRD) in Kubernetes?
4. How do you manage secrets and sensitive data in Kubernetes?
5. Describe the concept of Kubernetes namespaces and their significance.

**Kubernetes Security:**

1. How do you secure access to the Kubernetes API server?
2. Explain the role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
3. What are pod security policies (PSPs)? How do they enhance security?
4. How can you enforce network policies to control communication between pods?
5. What measures can be taken to secure container images used in Kubernetes deployments?

 1. Why do we need container orchestration.

	 1.1 What is container Runtime

	 1.2 What are different container orchestration tools (K8s, docker swarm)

 2. Why Kubernetes and not Docker swarm or something else (Details here 15 mins went here)

 3. Designing High Availability for Master nodes !

	 3.1 Quorum concept for leader selection

 4. What type of HA architecture havae you managed in terms of high availability or otherwise

 5. What is the Kubernetes Version you are running 

 6. How do you get configuration information for different clusters

 7. When you issue a kubectl command, what happens behind the scenes. Can you please run us through

 8. What are the different types of Objects in k8s. How to get the list of objects installed in the cluster

 9. Do we have some means of getting documentation of the resources in offline mode

10. Designing an application having two sets of services: Front end Service, Backend Service and DB Service. Share best practices and architecture	

11. Discuss aboout Stateful set and deployments in k8s

12. Share object used for scaling up the pods, say, in case of load increase

13. Discuss about Restart Policies as part of yaml files

14. Discuss different status of Pods. Like Pending status

15. How to resolve specific issues related to Pod status like OOM. Debugging approach based on the pod status

16. What is the concept of Image pullback / something similar

17. Can a Pod have multiple containers

18. Scenario: Very huge file, present in s3. User wish to download the file. Application Image can not handle it directly. It has to be downloaded and made available to the Pod. ....Concept of Init containers here 

19. Scenario: Central logging system. Want to use that system. Discuss the pattern used. .....Concept of sidecar Pattern

20. Discussion on best practice of having smallest possible Image size...

	20.1. Discussion on Ephemeral containes. Concept here

21. Scenario: Your application need to talk to some legacy application. Need to reduce the Image size.. Pattern to be used here to be discussed such as Ambassador pattern

22. Scenario: App B to communicate with App A using some endppoint. API A would give Json output, App B needs xml format. How to resolve this stalemate. Concept of Adapter / exporters container discussed !

23. What is the use of Replicaset / deployment

24. How to rollback to previous versions

25. Different deployment strategies in k8s. Pros and Cons for each of them
